    <h1>Khanh's Bio</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I'm a graduate of Tufts University  with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Finance. My interests are in natural language processing and stock investing. I'm also interested in learning about ways in which data can be used to inform business decisions. My hobbies are: cooking and baking, learning about skincare, exploring new restaurants, reading and playing Age of Empire.   </p>
